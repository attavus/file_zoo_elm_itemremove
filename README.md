# ItemRemove Element for YOOtheme ZOO ##

----------

[Element of the ItemRemove](http://www.raslab.org/en/filerepository/item/itemremove-element-for-zoo)  - displays a link to remove the item in the Front-end.
 
According to a tool tip in the submission section, if enabled, a submission will be used for direct item removing. There can be at most one item remove submission per app. The access level of this submission will determine who will be able to remove an item. You'll also have to assign the ItemRemove Element to the layout you want the Remove Item button to show on.
